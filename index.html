    <h1>Aptitude Test</h1>
    <p>
      This test uses symbols and numbers (rather than words) to generate a result.
      As such, students with an aptitude for numbers show an aptitude for this type of test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of the symbols as "commands" or "primitive functions".
      A result will be returned if the command is issued (i.e. the primitive function is applied).
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this test is to see if you can interpret what the result of the command means,
      and can therefore predict what the result will be of a similar command when applied to a different set of numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first set of questions, the commands are simple. The more advanced tabs have the same format of questions, but the difficulty increases.
      Questions in the more advanced tabs will use some of the commands that you have already been introduced to in previous tabs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each question has 2 parts:
      Part 1 contains a COMMAND and what the RESULT is when you apply the command to a set of numbers (or characters).
      Part 2 contains a SIMILAR COMMAND and you have to complete the column "MY ANSWER" to show what the result would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "command" will contain symbols such as @, #, % or a combination of symbols (such as +/).
      [E.g. if you see that 2#5 gives the answer 7, you will know that the command # is to add the 2 numbers together].
    </p>
    <p>
      The first 2 Questions already have the correct answers in the "MY ANSWER" column â€“ it serves as an example of how you must answer the questions that follow.
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">
      The sections you have to complete are highlighted in Green.
      Pay specific attention to those questions where the answer (green block) must have more than 1 row.
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 10px;">
      The score for each Question is in yellow.
